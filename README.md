# Fake-News-Detection
This project aims to identify and classify misleading or false news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. The system preprocesses text data by removing noise, tokenizing, and vectorizing it using TF-IDF or word embeddings. Various ML models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and LSTM are trained on labeled datasets to distinguish between real and fake news. The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Finally, a Streamlit web app is developed to allow users to input or upload news content and receive instant authenticity predictions, enhancing media reliability and user awareness.
